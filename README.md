# 🗣️ The Gossip Project - Ruby MVC Edition

Welcome! Here, you'll put into practice the **legendary MVC pattern** through a Ruby app that spills... gossip. Yes, **real juicy rumors** right in your terminal 💻🔥

## 🚀 Goal

Build an app using **OOP**, then level it up with **MVC** to:

- Create a gossip 📝  
- View all gossips 👀  

## 🧩 Key Concepts

- **Router**: asks the user what they want to do and redirects accordingly.  
- **Controller**: central hub for actions, connects the view and the model.  
- **Model (Gossip)**: represents gossip data and interacts with the CSV file.  
- **View**: manages terminal input/output using puts/gets.  

## 💾 Tech Stack

- Ruby  
- CSV  
- Custom MVC (no Rails)
